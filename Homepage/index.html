                <h3 class="title1">A brief biography</h3>
                <p>I was born in Beijing, a northern city in China,
                    and I lived in this city for almost two decades.
                    I chose an out-of-town college when I was 18. 
                    When the first year I study in college, a friend 
                    and I tried to build a phone App which aims to reduce
                    and eliminate the information gaps between the customer 
                    and the diving shop. </p>
                <P>I have learnt Java and web building while doing this project,
                    which gave me a basic understanding of computer language.
                    After that, I began to concentrate on college courses.
                    I have developed a strong interest in macroeconomics
                    during this year, While my college courses focus on
                    finance. Thus, I have chosen to take a gap year at
                    the beginning of the third college year(Sep 2022).</P>

                        <h3>Computer Skills</h3>
                        <p>I am proficient in writing Python 
                            code in basic programming, web crawler,
                             and data visualization, and I can build 
                             webpages with html, css, and javascript at
                              a relatively low speed. Moreover, I can
                               read Java code.</p>
                        <p>Learning a computer language is helpful for 
                            my studying, but as an economics student,
                             I found there are only a few chances I need
                              to use a computer language. In most cases, 
                              the softwares can do better. </p>
                        <p>Interestingly, Java is the first computer 
                            language I learned, but after one year of
                             barely using it, I almost forgot how to 
                             write it.</p>

                            <h3>Philosophy & music & sports</h3>
                            <p>Philosophy is one of my favourite subjects.
                                 I had an English tutor who was majoring in
                                  philosophy. We usually spend a large proportion 
                                  of time discussing philosophy subjects during 
                                  English courses. I remember that I was 
                                  particularly interested in the subject of
                                   public order and universal value. I even 
                                   thought choosing philosophy as my college major.</p>
                            <p>My favourite sport is diving, while both my hometown 
                                and my university are inland cities. Thus, 
                                cycling has become the sport I often do.</p>
                                <p>I can play a traditional Chinese instrument, 
                                    Erhu. I received the qualification for grade 
                                    eight(out of ten) from the central conservatory
                                     of music</p>

                            <p>Though I have travelled to a lot of countries, 
                                I'm not too fond of travelling. I think travelling 
                                is nothing more than taking all kinds of vehicles 
                                and walking.</p>
                            <p> I think travelling 
                                    is nothing more than taking all kinds of vehicles 
                                    and walking.</p>
                            <p>While my parents like travelling, so, for me, 
                                travelling is a good way to enjoy family time.</p>
